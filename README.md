## 📜 Credits

- This application was made with [Elicoin GUI Miner ⇗](https://github.com/elicoin/elicoin-gui-miner) and [XMrig ⇗.](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig)

## ❔ But how? 

- Of course you can't mine ETH with a CPU but we mine Monero (RandomX) and convert it on the pool to ETH.

## 👀 How do I start?

- Put in your ETH address (and optional threads) and click "Start Mining".

## 💹 What is the fee? 

- The miner itself takes 1% fee and the pool 0.75% so thats 1.75% fee.

## 🏅 Where do i check how much i earned?

- To check how much you earned go to https://www.unmineable.com/coins/ETH/xxxxxxxxx and put in your ETH address.

> **Minimum payout is 0.01 ETH**
