A CPU miner ‚õè that mines ETH
</b>
</p>

- This application was made with [Elicoin GUI Miner](https://github.com/elicoin/elicoin-gui-miner) and [XMrig.](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig)

A miner that is user friendly to mine Ethereum with your CPU.

But how? 

Of course you can't mine ETH with a CPU but we mine Monero (RandomX) and convert it on the pool to ETH.

How do I start?

Put in your ETH address (and optional threads) and click "Start Mining".

What is the fee? 

The miner itself takes 1% fee and the pool 0.75% so thats 1.75% fee.

Where do i check how much i earned?

To check how much you earned go to https://www.unmineable.com/coins/ETH/address and put in your ETH address.

Minimum payout is 0.01 ETH
